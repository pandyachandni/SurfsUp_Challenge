1. The average temperature for June 75°F for June which is higher than the average temperature of 71°F for December. The opposite is true for rainfall. In December that average was 0.22 inches while for June it was 0.14 inches.

2. The histograms help show that even though there are a minimum and maximum, the frequency still stays around the two different means. Using the same ranges for both months, it has has been seen June skews slightly to the left while December is symmetrical.

3. There is also a trend with the slopes comparing precipitation and temperature. June has a steeper slope of -0.037 compared to December which is -0.019. This shows that as the temperature increases, rainfall decreases.
